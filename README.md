# ScheduleTerp

[scheduleterp.com](https://scheduleterp.com)

A platform to build your UMD schedule using data from Testudo and PlanetTerp—complete with walking and biking times between classes, all in one smart interface.

## Features

- 🌈 Customize the color of different sections

- ⚡ Dynamic indicators in the section list that show whether a section fits in your schedule (✅), intersects with another class (❌), or has a travel time conflict (⚠️) so you don't have to hover over every single one

- 👀 Key section information (ratings, GPA, low seat count) is dynamically colored 🟢🟡🔴 so you can analyze a section with a single glance

- 📅 Export schedules to your calendar (.ics file)

- 🔗 Share your schedule by link!

- 📱 Mobile-friendly!

- 🚶‍♂️🚴‍♀️ Choose walking or biking as your mode of travel and ScheduleTerp will dynamically calculate the actual amount of time it'll take to travel between your classes to identify travel time conflicts

- ⏱️ Travel time conflicts can be shown directly on your schedule including both the amount of time you have between two classes and the amount of time ScheduleTerp calculated you'd need to travel between them

- 📊 GPA data by professor so you can choose which professor to take for a course not only by their ratings, but also by the average GPA students had with them in the past
